    <h2> This is me </h2>
    <img src="img_0055.jpg" alt="Me" style="height:400px;">
    <p> My coding journey started in second grade in high school. I had IT1
    as one of my subjects. I thought that was fun, but a bit difficult, so I
    decided not to have IT2. In IT1 we learned HTML and CSS, so I hope that
    will come back to me now.</p>
    <p> Then three years later when I started at NTNU I had ITGK. Here we used
    Python, but I thought that had some similarities to HTML, so that went well.
    Last year I had a subject called "Prototyping av interaktive media". In this
    subject you do a lot of programming, but unfortunately someone in my group
    was very good at this, so I was given other tasks. </p>
    <p> As you understand I have tried some code languages, but never felt
    that I really learned it properly. So I'm looking foreward to this course,
    I hope that my coding skills will be better after this semester. Luckily for
    me I think that programming is fun, so I think that this is going to be a
    fun subject. I also like how the course is structured, with weekly
    assignments, a group project and an exam in the end. I think that will
    provide high learning benefits. </p>

    <h2> Questions </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The server in the client server architecture is software running on a
      computer. The server is responding to requests from the client.</li>
      <li>The client is the browser. It locate and display information
      from the web.</li>
      <li> IP stands for "Internet Protocol". An IP address is a unique address
      that every device on the Internet are given so that they can communicate
      across the Internet. Each IP address has four parts, each part a number
      between 0 and 255.</li>
      <li> DNS stands for "Domain Name System" and it's the phonebook of the
      Internet. Because it would be difficult to remember an IP address when
      you are entering a website, every website has its own domain name, like
      facebook.com. The task of the DNS is to translate this domain into an
      IP address so that the browser can load Internet resources.</li>
      <li> The difference between the Internet and the WWW is that WWW are
      the pages you see when you are at a device and you are online, like for
      example facebook.com. But the Internet is the network of connected
      computers that the web works on. This is not someting you can see,
      like a webpage. </li>
      <li> HTML stands for "Hyper Text Markup Language" and is the standard
      coding language for creating webpages. The language describes the
      structure of a webpage and consists of a series of elements. </li>
    </ol>
